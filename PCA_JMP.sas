/*It includes the following steps:*/

/*First: Load normalized data into JMP*/

/*Second: 
-Perform PCA using Analyze option: Multivariate Methods:Principal Components Analysis;
-We can choose to perform PCA using the covariance matrix. Click the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors option to display the eigenvalue matrix and Eigenvector matrix; 
-Save Columns option allows one to save Principal Components to the original data set by choosing choose how many PCs we want to save;
